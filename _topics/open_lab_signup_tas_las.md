Open lab hours refers to the times that these rooms:

* Phelps 3525, 3526, 2510

Are reserved for TAs/LAs/Instructors to hold in-person office hours for these courses:

* CMPSC 5A, 5B
* CMPSC 8 (in-person version)
* CMPSC 9, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64
* CMPSC 40, 130A, 130B
* CMPSC 148, 156

Starting with W23, we are piloting a new process for signing up for these hours.

# How TAs/LAs sign up for office hours

First, your instructor will need to set up the calendar using these instructions:

* <https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/topics/open_lab_signup_instructor/>

Then, to sign up for office hours:

1. Below there is a link to a calendar that shows when Phelps 3525, 3526 and 2510 are available.  Please open this link in a browser window.
   * [UCSB CS Open Lab Hours]({{page.open_lab_hours_cal_url}})

2. Take note of the times that the room is available in the calendar linked to above. 
   
   You are encouraged to hold your office hours during the time slots shown in the UCSB CS Open Lab Hours calendar above, either in Phelps 3525, 3526, or 2510.
   
   The reasons include:
   
   * Providing a space where multiple classes are holding office hours allows TAs/LAs/Students from multiple classes to intermingle and help one another
   * It helps ease crowding in the TA trailer; the open lab times tend to have more space.
   
   However, if it is helpful or necessary for them to hold office hours at other times, please discuss with your instructor the possibility of holding
   them either (a) online on zoom, or (b) using the "TA Trailer", or some other location.

3. Add an event to the calendar for each slot during which you are planning to hold office hours. 

   In order to keep the entries consistent and concise, please use this format for the title:

   * CS8, Chris Gaucho, 3525
   * CS16, Terry Phelps, 2510
   * etc.

   It is not necessary to include "Office Hours" or "Phelps" or anything else; those just take up space and make it harder to read the calendar.
   
   You may think that the CS8 is redundant since the calendar is only for a particular class, but **please include it**; we will be aggregating 
   multiple calendars into one in order to check the room utilization, so it is helpful for the entries to be in this format, and consistent.
   
4. You will probably want to make the events "repeating" events using "Custom", setting it to be weekly, and then ending on the last day of the
   quarter, which for W23 is 03/17/2023.
   
5. If you need to make "one off" adjustments to your office hours, or cancel them because you are sick, you should first communicate with your
   instructor and fellow course staff members (i.e. the TAs and LAs that also teach your class) as well as the students in your class; your instructor
   will clarify how you should do that.  But, once you've done that, you can adjust the calendar event either permanently or for a "one time event".
