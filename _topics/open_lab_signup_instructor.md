Open lab hours refers to the times that these rooms:

* Phelps 3525, 3526, 2510

Are reserved for TAs/LAs/Instructors to hold in-person office hours for these courses:

* CMPSC 5A, 5B
* CMPSC 8 (in-person version)
* CMPSC 9, 16, 24, 32, 40, 64
* CMPSC 40, 130A, 130B
* CMPSC 148, 156

Starting with W23, we are piloting a new process for signing up for these hours.

# Instructor Steps

You can visit the link below to see the calendar that shows all of the times that the rooms are available.

* [UCSB CS Open Lab Hours]({{page.open_lab_hours_cal_url}})
   
TAs/LAs are encouraged to sign up for office hours during these times.  If it is helpful or necessary for them to hold office hours at other times,
they may do so either (a) online on zoom, or (b) using the "TA Trailer", or some other location.

Please:

1. Create a Google Calendar specifically for office hours for your course
2. Add phtcon@ucsb.edu, diba@ucsb.edu, and all of your TAs and LAs to the calendar.  Be sure to add them with the permission 
3. Send an email to phtcon@ucsb.edu, diba@ucsb.edu informing them that you 
4. Send them a link to the calendar, and to this page, and ask them to follow the instructions in the section "Staff Steps" below.
5. Instructors may wish to add entries for events such as these so that the calendar is useful for the students in the course.

   * CS8 Staff Mtg
   * CS24 Lecture
   * CS32 Sections

   If so, please put details such as location, etc. in the description as opposed to the title.  Also, please follow the naming convention
   shown above; this will help us aggregate the individual calendars into one view so that we can get a sense of the room utilization.


# How TAs/LAs sign up for office hours

To sign up for office hours:

1. Below there is a link to a calendar that shows when Phelps 3525, 3526 and 2510 are available.  Please open this link in a browser window.
   * [UCSB CS Open Lab Hours]({{page.open_lab_hours_cal_url}})

2. Take note of the times that the room is available in the calendar linked to above. 
   
   You are encouraged to hold your office hours during the time slots shown in the UCSB CS Open Lab Hours calendar above, either in Phelps 3525, 3526, or 2510.
   
   The reasons include:
   
   * Providing a space where multiple classes are holding office hours allows TAs/LAs/Students from multiple classes to intermingle and help one another
   * It helps ease crowding in the TA trailer; the open lab times tend to have more space.
   
   However, if it is helpful or necessary for them to hold office hours at other times, please discuss with your instructor the possibility of holding
   them either (a) online on zoom, or (b) using the "TA Trailer", or some other location.

3. Add an event to the calendar for each slot during which you are planning to hold office hours. 

   In order to keep the entries consistent and concise, please use this format for the title:

   * CS8, Chris Gaucho, 3525
   * CS16, Terry Phelps, 2510
   * etc.

   It is not necessary to include "Office Hours" or "Phelps" or anything else; those just take up space and make it harder to read the calendar.
   
   You may think that the CS8 is redundant since the calendar is only for a particular class, but **please include it**; we will be aggregating 
   multiple calendars into one in order to check the room utilization, so it is helpful for the entries to be in this format, and consistent.
   
4. You will probably want to make the events "repeating" events using "Custom", setting it to be weekly, and then ending on the last day of the
   quarter, which for W23 is 03/17/2023.
   
5. If you need to make "one off" adjustments to your office hours, or cancel them because you are sick, you should first communicate with your
   instructor and fellow course staff members (i.e. the TAs and LAs that also teach your class) as well as the students in your class; your instructor
   will clarify how you should do that.  But, once you've done that, you can adjust the calendar event either permanently or for a "one time event".
