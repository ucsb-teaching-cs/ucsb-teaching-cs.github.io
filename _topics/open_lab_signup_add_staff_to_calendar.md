# Is your course on this list?

Visit the list here to see if a calendar is already setup for your course:

* <https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/topics/open_lab_calendars/>

If so, you are ready for the steps below.

Otherwise, visit this link to get your calendar added: <>


# Adding multiple TAs/LAs at once

If you are the person responsible for adding TAs/LAs to the course, you'll first need to be given access to the Google Calendar with the permission level "

This animation shows how to copy/paste a whole group of emails from a spreadsheet or list to add multiple TAs/LAs at the same time:

# Then, invite your TAs/LAs to create events on the calendar

Send each of your TAs and LAs a message saying:

> I've invited you to a Google Calendar called "CSxxx Office Hours".
> Please take these steps next:
> * Find the calendar invite in your email; it will look like this:
>   <img width="606" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/211951460-bec4c768-fd17-475e-8afe-718e46ae92b7.png">
> * In the email, click the link where it says `Add this calendar`
> * Please then read and follow these instructions about adding your office hours to the calendar
>   * <https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/topics/open_lab_signup_tas_las/>
> * Please be sure that you add the events in the format requested, e.g. `CSxxx, Name, Location`
> * It is not necessary to write `Office Hours` in your event title; since everything on the calendar is office hours unless otherwise specified.

You may add any additional instructions you like about the number of office hours, etc.

# If you like, add additional events

Instructors may wish to add entries for events such as these so that the calendar is useful for the students in the course.

   * CS8 Staff Mtg
   * CS24 Lecture
   * CS32 Sections

If so, please put details such as location, etc. in the description as opposed to the title.  Also, please follow the naming convention
shown above; this will help us aggregate the individual calendars into one view so that we can get a sense of the room utilization.
